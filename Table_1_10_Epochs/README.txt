Step 1: Run the code in the Data_Generator.Rmd file. This will generate the data to be used in the simulations.


Now we may run the desired simulations. Note: For the Python methods, the RAM and VRAM measurements are only accurate for the first measurement. RAM and VRAM measurements must be collected manually after restarting the Python Kernel each measurement. More instructions are in the Simulations_1D.ipynb notebook. The following steps may be performed independently so you only need to execute the step you wish to reproduce.


Step HS-SVD: Open the HS-SVD_1D.ipynb file and follow the instructions. Make sure that your working directory leads to the Table_1 folder.

Step NNGP: Open the NNGP_1D.Rmd file and follow the instructions. Make sure that your working directory leads to the Table_1 folder.

Step GPyTorch: Open the Simulations_1D.ipynb file and follow the instructions. Make sure that your working directory leads to the Table_1 folder.
